# The git depth parameter requires a very fine balance for large repos with
# many merges like the Linux kernel.
#
# - When it's too deep it won't save much time because the number of
#   commits is an approximately exponential function of depth because of
#   the very frequent merges.
#
# - When it's too shallow it will save zero time because fetching pull
#   requests with a base older than the shallow history will take as
#   much time as cloning the entire repo... without even providing the
#   entire repo information as checkpatch seems to be producing very
#   confusing garbage in that case. See example and discussion in
#   https://github.com/thesofproject/linux/pull/2341
#   (The workaround is of course to rebase the pull request)
