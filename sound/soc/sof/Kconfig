config SND_SOC_SOF
	tristate "Sound Open Firmware Support"
	select SND_SOC_TOPOLOGY
	select SND_SOC_COMPRESS
	help
          This adds support for Sound Open Firmware (SOF). SOF is a free and
	  generic open source audio DSP firmware for multiple devices.
          Say Y if you have such a device that is supported by SOF.
          If unsure select "N".

config SND_SOC_SOF_NOCODEC
	tristate "SOF nocodec mode Support"
	depends on SND_SOC_SOF
	help
          This adds support for a dummy/nocodec machine driver fallback
	  option if no known codec is detected. This is typically only
	  enabled for developers or devices where the sound card is
	  controlled externally
          Say Y if you need this nocodec fallback option
          If unsure select "N".

config SND_SOC_SOF_DEBUG
	bool "SOF debugging features"
	depends on SND_SOC_SOF
	help
	  This option can be used to enable or disable individual SOF firmware
	  and driver debugging options.
	  Say Y if you are debugging SOF FW or drivers.
          If unsure select "N".

config SND_SOC_SOF_FORCE_NOCODEC_MODE
	bool "SOF force nocodec Mode"
	depends on SND_SOC_SOF_NOCODEC
	depends on SND_SOC_SOF_DEBUG
	help
          This forces SOF to use dummy/nocodec as machine driver, even
	  though there is a codec detected on the real platform. This is
	  typically only enabled for developers for debug purposes, before
	  codec/machine driver is ready, or to exclude the impact of those
	  drivers
          Say Y if you need this force nocodec mode option
          If unsure select "N".

config SND_SOC_SOF_DEBUG_XRUN_STOP
	bool "SOF stop on XRUN"
	depends on SND_SOC_SOF_DEBUG
	help
	  This option forces PCMs to stop on any XRUN event. This is useful to
	  preserve any trace data ond pipeline status prior to the XRUN.
	  Say Y if you are debugging SOF FW pipeline XRUNs.
          If unsure select "N".

config SND_SOC_SOF_DEBUG_VERBOSE_IPC
	bool "SOF verbose IPC logs"
	depends on SND_SOC_SOF_DEBUG
	help
	  This option enables more verbose IPC logs, with command types in
	  human-readable form instead of just 32-bit hex dumps. This is useful
	  if you are trying to debug IPC with the DSP firmware.
          If unsure select "N".

config SND_SOC_SOF_DEBUG_FORCE_IPC_POSITION
	bool "SOF force to use IPC for position update on SKL+"
	depends on SND_SOC_SOF_DEBUG
	default n
	help
	  This option force to handle stream position update IPCs and run pcm
	  elapse to inform ALSA about that, on platforms (e.g. Intel SKL+) that
	  with other approach (e.g. HDAC DPIB/posbuf) to elapse PCM.
	  On platforms (e.g. Intel SKL-) where position update IPC is the only
	  one choice, this setting won't impact anything.
	  if you are trying to debug pointer update with position IPCs or where
	  DPIB/posbuf is not ready, select "Y".
          If unsure select "N".
